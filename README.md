# 🍕 Pizza Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📊 Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive and visually appealing **Power BI dashboard** that analyzes pizza sales performance using a historical dataset. It focuses on understanding sales trends, customer preferences, and business performance across various dimensions like date, category, and size.

While SQL was not used to build the dashboard, I used it **separately to validate key metrics** such as revenue, average order value, and order trends for accuracy.
